    <div class="personality">
    <p>I am a jolly good fellow passionate about the development of the African tech ecosystem. I believe Africa has a lot to offer and the world is about to see a new wave of talent and innovative solutions.</p>
      <p>I love hacking technology products, taking pictures of nature, writing, singing , traveling, reading and doing yoga. When I’m not strategizing with my colleagues, researching or learning to code, I’m often doing song covers, planning travels or trying out a new meal recipe.</p>
